# E-commerce-Campaign data:  EDA & Hypothesis testing with Python

ðŸŽ¯ Problem statement

To conduct a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing on two comprehensive datasets one containing information on customers visiting the shopping site for purchase and another that has demographic, purchase, and marketing information about the group of people.

# steps performed

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed various features like income, education, spending categories, and marital status.
   - Visualized distributions using histograms and box plots, identifying skewed features and outliers.
   - Removed extreme values (outliers) where necessary to improve the analysis.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features such as:
     - **Income Brackets**: Divided income into two groups (below and above median income).
     - **Couples vs. Singles**: Grouped marital statuses into "In Couple" (Married, Together) and "Alone" (Divorced, Single, Widow, YOLO, Absurd).
     - **Campaign Acceptance**: Created a binary feature indicating whether a customer accepted any campaign.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - **Income vs. Education**:
     - **Hypothesis**: Is the income of customers dependent on their education level?
     - Conducted suitable tests (Chi-square or ANOVA) to check if there's a significant relationship between income and education.
   
   - **Income vs. Total Spending**:
     - **Hypothesis**: Do higher-income individuals spend more across all categories?
     - Performed correlation analysis and t-tests to examine the relationship between income and total spending.

   - **Couples vs. Singles (Wine Spending)**:
     - **Hypothesis**: Do couples spend more or less on wine compared to people living alone?
     - Conducted t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests to compare wine spending between "In Couple" and "Alone" groups.

   - **Income vs. Campaign Acceptance**:
     - **Hypothesis**: Are people with lower income more likely to accept campaigns?
     - Split data into two income groups and checked campaign acceptance rates using Chi-square or logistic regression tests.

4. **Assumptions and Test Selection**:
   - Selected appropriate statistical tests (e.g., t-tests, Chi-square, ANOVA) based on the type of data and hypotheses.
   - Verified normality and homogeneity of variance using visualizations (histograms, Q-Q plots) and statistical tests (Levene's, Shapiro-Wilk).
   
5. **Results and Conclusions**:
   - Derived insights and accepted or rejected null hypotheses based on p-values, summarizing the findings for each analysis.
